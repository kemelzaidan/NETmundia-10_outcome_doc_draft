PRELIMINARY NETMUNDIAL+10 OUTCOME DOCUMENT, São Paulo, Brazil

April 25th, 2024

# 1. Global Challenges for the Governance of the Digital World

Convened in São Paulo, Brazil, in April 2024, stakeholders from around
the world asserted the need for improvements to the governance of the
digital realm - and spelled out how to bring all stakeholders, people,
cultures, countries and distinct economies together to solve the common
challenges we face. Such challenges transcend our divisions and can only
be resolved by harnessing the energy of our disagreements, arguments,
and hopes to shape a better future for all.

Given the rapid digital transformation and continuous innovation and
spread of multiple Internet-based technologies and applications,
including the role of new digital and disruptive technologies such as
Artificial Intelligence, the governance of the digital world faces new
challenges and so requires improvement.

These technologies open up great opportunities for accelerating human,
social and economic development and tackling inequalities, building more
inclusive societies. At the same time, if not properly managed, they
also bring uncertainties, insecurities, and asymmetries among countries,
deepening divides. No stakeholder can handle these challenges alone.

The governance of the digital world, more than ever, requires
unprecedented coordination and cooperation among stakeholders to
effectively unlock the benefits of this massive transformation for
everyone, everywhere -- and to collaboratively prevent and remediate
abuses online.

To strengthen multistakeholder spaces for participation, it is necessary
to improve mechanisms for building consensus and producing guidelines
and recommendations in such a way that communities\' voices have an
impact on multilateral and other decision-making processes, so that
effective solutions to the challenges we face can be found and
implemented.

The 2014 NETmundial meeting was groundbreaking, marking a significant
milestone in the evolution of Internet governance. As we approach the
20th anniversary of the World Summit on the Information Society and the
Tunis Agenda and a decade after NETmundial, it is high time to address
the lingering unresolved issue: how to help all actors to contribute to
multistakeholder process to create the networked global governance
architecture that is human-centric, inclusive, environmentally friendly,
and development-oriented, as the networked society demands.

In this context, NETmundial+10 had the focus of bolstering the digital
governance architecture, bringing together key stakeholders to deliver
concrete, non-binding recommendations on how to strengthen the
multistakeholder approach as the basis for consensus-building and
democratic governance, including in existing multilateral and other
relevant decisional fora.

NETmundial+10 reaffirms existing principles to guide the governance of
the digital realm, proposes procedures to do so effectively, and
delivers messages to shape intergovernmental dialogues and decisions on
the future of digital governance. NETmundial+10 reaffirms the need to
build an effective and functioning governance architecture that
facilitates an informed, participatory and transparent debate between
sectors, in a multistakeholder model. This is the best way to contribute
to the construction of a digital world that respects fundamental rights
and fosters inclusive societies that promote peace, prosperity and
environmental sustainability for all.

To help address these challenges, the NETmundial+10:

-   Reaffirms the continued relevance of the 10 principles for Internet
    governance processes adopted in 2014, including for new, more recent
    digital policy challenges;
-   Offers operational guidelines to help the implementation of these
    principles in a diversity of situations; and
-   Provides input into various ongoing processes regarding the
    evolution of the governance architecture for digital issues.

This document represents the outcome of a collaborative, open, and
inclusive process, shaped by 154 written, online contributions from
representatives of governments, the private sector, civil society, and
the technical and academic communities gathered through an open
consultation held between March and April 2024. The consultation was
structured around three main topics: Principles for Digital Governance
Processes, Guidelines for the Implementation of Multistakeholder
Mechanisms, and Contributions to Ongoing Governance Processes.

Based on the undertaken consultations, valuable inputs were also
gathered from more than 800 participants attending both in person and
online on the two days of the event.

Even with the rapid technical, social, and economic transformations that
have taken place since then, these Process Principles remain relevant
and valid in addressing today's digital governance challenges and
represent a distinct and important reference for all stakeholders in how
the governance system dealing with Internet and digital policy issues
should be shaped. As they have not yet been fully implemented, there is
a need for collaborative efforts toward their full application, opening
more and better opportunities for all stakeholders to meaningfully
participate, especially in multilateral digital policy mechanisms.

The 2014 NETmundial process principles should be the basis of any future
evolution in digital governance, and it is vital for all stakeholders to
fully implement them, as a shared vision of the community.

## 2.2. The "multistakeholder" process principle

The 2014 Process Principle regarding multistakeholderism reads as:

> *Multistakeholder: Internet governance should be built on democratic,
> multistakeholder processes, ensuring the meaningful and accountable
> participation of all stakeholders, including governments, the private
> sector, civil society, the technical community, the academic community
> and users. The respective roles and responsibilities of stakeholders
> should be interpreted in a flexible manner with reference to the issue
> under discussion.*

Each stakeholder group has different roles and responsibilities,
depending on the topic and phases of specific governance processes. The
distribution of roles and responsibilities between stakeholders is an
ongoing (and contentious) subject of debate.

There are persisting concerns that too many governance processes are
failing to properly apply the multistakeholder Process Principle,
especially due to the lack of inclusive and meaningful participation of
all relevant stakeholders. Excluding key stakeholders from the
decision-making process can indeed be a critical factor leading to
failure.

Multistakeholder approaches to Internet and digital governance work best
when they are inclusive, and when stakeholders can identify their own
interest in an issue and participate in processes to address it. This is
because it is the very clash of perspectives, insights, interests and
priorities that generates the solutions needed.

This means that to gain the most positive benefits from governance
processes in the digital realm, the roles and responsibilities of
stakeholders must be interpreted flexibly and openly. Sectors,
organizations and individuals must not be shut out of a given process
due to an outdated categorisation that was suggested in the past.

That said, a vital component of protecting and improving such processes
is to select the relevant forms of expertise and experience that are
required at different stages of discussing a particular issue. This also
implies a realistic analysis of (and response to) the power asymmetries
between and within stakeholders in a discussion.

## 2.3. Coordination of governance spaces

Numerous initiatives and processes have emerged to address the broad
diversity of issues raised by the digital transformation. Sometimes,
multiple processes address the same issues in parallel. This has both
positive and negative impacts.

Distributed initiatives on a particular issue can help cover the
diversity of approaches and perspectives. At the same time, there is a
risk that separate discussions on a specific issue may create
incompatible and even conflicting outcomes. There are also difficulties
posed for stakeholders to follow simultaneous and duplicative processes,
especially for stakeholders from the Global South. Better coordination
between processes dealing with overlapping issues is strongly needed.

The Internet Governance Forum (including its intersessional work and
network of national and regional initiatives), can deliver on this need,
by strengthening its coordination and information-sharing roles. Its
open nature, hybrid approach and inclusive design attract support. Such
roles may need new working methods to be developed that can deliver
genuinely improved coordination, information sharing, outcome
deliberation and insight, while avoiding conflicts with existing
processes or creating new burdens, and ensuring bottom-up participation,
transparency and accountability in governance processes.

Working methods that drive stronger connections between governance
processes and implementation of outcomes would strengthen the overall
effectiveness of digital and Internet governance.

Effective improvements in coordination will benefit all stakeholders and
the ability of the Internet and digital governance system to deal with
the issues they are addressing.

# 3. Guidelines for the implementation of multistakeholder mechanisms

## 3.1. Participation in multilateral processes

Multilateral processes benefit from involving broad stakeholder input.
Better decisions can be achieved, and better delivery of outcomes
assured, by involving diverse voices in inclusive processes
appropriately designed to incorporate multiple worldviews, enable
adequate deliberation and support consensus-building. Multilateral
processes need to be more inclusive to ensure the meaningful
participation of all stakeholders from the Global South.

To achieve these gains, all stakeholders should be empowered to
contribute in a meaningful way to all stages of a process tackling
issues of concern. The appointment of advisory/expert roles and/or
platforms adequately resourced should be encouraged, to effectively
facilitate and analyze diverse contributions from the agenda-setting
phase, during deliberations, and on draft resolutions, following agreed
guidelines and timeframes and incorporating ethical and public interest
considerations. Similarly, investments in capacity-building and
education to strengthen effective contributions are vital. It is
important that such investments account for the relative power
differences among different actors.

In the spirit of the multistakeholder principles, multilateral processes
should evolve. They must share the scope of their work and publish a
commitment regarding transparency of the process, including but not
limited to a timeline highlighting critical opportunities for
participation. As part of that commitment, a regular schedule to inform
about their progress - or lack thereof must be made available, including
access to specific outputs. Documentation of how contributions were
made, evaluated and incorporated into the process will be as important
as the documentation related to dissenting and divergent views. Such
mechanisms must follow accessibility standards, and provide alternatives
to facilitate participation in languages other than English.

Robust accountability mechanisms should be part of all multilateral
processes, so that there are clear steps and deadlines for the
implementation of recommendations. Concrete mechanisms for reflection
about the impact of their decisions and the status of implementation of
their recommendations are key for continuity. Efforts to accurately
document each multilateral process should be made, including concrete
steps to identify linkages with other similar processes.

## 3.2. Guidelines for multistakeholder consensus-building and decision-making

We offer the worldwide community a set of guidelines and related process
steps ("Guidelines"), that are distilled from existing foundational
documents as well as from current good practice and experience. While no
one size fits all, they shall help sub-national, national, regional, and
global communities to establish and implement multistakeholder
collaboration processes and mechanisms, as well as to assess processes
and mechanisms that are presented as being multistakeholder, but are so
only by their name.

The following guidelines are a complement to and operationalize the 2014
NETmundial Internet Governance Process Principles. Due to the
ever-evolving nature of multistakeholder collaboration, these guidelines
cannot be cast in stone and have to be considered as a living document.
They need to keep on evolving, both in their practical implementation as
in their concrete wording.

We therefore recommend that the IGF is best suited to act as depositary
of this first set of guidelines, and we look forward to the IGF
considering its implementation in its own processes, and its further
discussion and evolution.

**Guidelines and process steps ("Guidelines") for multistakeholder
collaboration, consensus-building and decision-making**

### Guidelines

1.  Multistakeholder processes should empower stakeholders by providing
    them with the necessary information, resources, and skills to
    participate effectively. Transparency measures should aim for making
    policy processes comprehensible and actionable.
2.  Multistakeholder processes should involve informed and deliberative
    discussion among stakeholders.
3.  Stakeholders should participate on equal footing, treat each other
    with mutual respect, recognizing the value of diverse viewpoints and
    contributions and the different nature of their roles and
    responsibilities in an issue-specific manner.
4.  Multistakeholder processes should be governed by the rule of law,
    with respect to international human rights principles, including
    economic, social and cultural rights.
5.  Multistakeholder processes should be accessible to all stakeholders,
    regardless of their background, status, or level of expertise.
6.  Stakeholders should share responsibility and uphold accountability
    in their respective roles for the outcomes of the multistakeholder
    process, with legal and political accountability for protection of
    human rights remaining the primary responsibility of governments.
7.  Digital governance processes should be agile and adaptable to
    changing circumstances, evolving technologies, emerging issues, and
    changing geopolitical dynamics.
8.  Multistakeholder processes should strive to treat all stakeholders
    fairly and equitably, considering their respective needs,
    capacities, realities, and vulnerabilities.
9.  Mechanisms for resolving conflicts among stakeholders should be in
    place to enable decision-making.
10. A global multistakeholder approach to digital governance should
    recognize the need for collaborative action across national borders
    and stakeholder groups, while duly considering and leveraging local
    and regional perspectives.
11. Decisions should consider the long-term implications and
    sustainability of outcomes for human rights, and inclusive
    development, as per the Tunis agenda.
12. Capacity-building efforts enhance understanding and skills of
    stakeholders, particularly those from developing countries and
    underrepresented communities.
13. Cooperation and dialogue should be sought with other governance fora
    and processes, in order to avoid duplication of efforts and to share
    best practices and lessons learned.
14. Ensure that the collaboration process is oriented towards practical,
    actionable outcomes that lead to tangible results and positive
    changes towards the governance of the Internet.

### Process steps oriented guidelines

**Recommended process steps **for an open and inclusive multistakeholder
process

1.  Scope the issue/s: define the issue or set of issues to be
    considered by the multistakeholder collaboration process,
    considering, as much as possible, all affected perspectives.
2.  Identify Stakeholders: Identify all relevant stakeholders, including
    individuals, groups, organizations, and communities affected by the
    decision or collaboration.\"
3.  Engage Stakeholders: Actively engage all interested stakeholders
    through methods such as public consultations, surveys, workshops,
    and forums to gather input and feedback.
4.  Share Information: Provide clear information about the process,
    objectives, and outcomes to ensure transparency and understanding
    among stakeholders.
5.  Ensure equitable participation: Ensure equitable participation of
    all relevant diverse perspectives and interests, including
    marginalized or underrepresented groups.
6.  Facilitate Dialogue: Facilitate open dialogue, collaboration and
    deliberation among relevant stakeholders, encouraging respectful
    communication and consensus-building.
7.  Prepare draft outcomes: develop draft outcomes for consultation on
    the basis of dialogues between relevant stakeholders, and consult
    the wider community of all interested stakeholders over results.
8.  Factor in feedback from wider community: adapt the draft outcomes
    taking into account the inputs stemming from the consultation,
    transparently reporting on how inputs were considered, and the
    corresponding reasons.
9.  Open decision-making: use collaborative decision-making processes
    that involve all the relevant stakeholders in identifying solutions,
    exploring trade-offs, and reaching agreements.
10. Community powers: submit final outcomes to the consideration of the
    wider community, providing for mechanisms empowering the wider
    community to react to outcomes that are inconsistent with the wider
    community interests.
11. Implementation and accountability in decision-making: Establish
    mechanisms for implementing decisions and holding stakeholders
    accountable for their commitments.
12. Monitor and Adapt: Monitor progress, evaluate outcomes, and be
    willing to adapt the process based on feedback and changing
    circumstances.

# 4. Input to ongoing processes

As stated in Section 2.3, several processes are currently under way in
the UN context regarding the coordination and governance of digital
technologies and development, in particular the negotiations around the
Global Digital Compact (GDC) in the framework of the Pact for the
Future, and the WSIS+20 review. They include recommendations and
potential pathways for the further development of the Internet and the
broader digital ecosystem contributing to the achievement of the
Sustainable Development Goals -- SDGs. As a unique gathering that seeks
to articulate a concrete pathway for multistakeholderism in Internet and
digital governance, NETmundial+10 presents specific messages to these
processes oriented to ensure synergies, coordination and
complementarity.

## 4.1. Internet Governance Forum (IGF)

The Internet Governance Forum consists of its annual event,
intersessional work in the form of dynamic coalitions, best practice
fora and policy networks, parliamentary and judiciary tracks, and
national, regional and youth initiatives. It brings together all
stakeholder groups from different parts of the world.

The IGF has been an effective space for Internet governance and digital
public policy debates and cooperation, in spite of lacking the required
financial resources to meet its mandate optimally. The IGF has the
proven convening power and capacity to further explore and evolve
innovative multistakeholder approaches to policy deliberation and
decision-making processes. If strengthened, it could be consolidated as
the preferred space for information sharing and improved coordination
among digital governance processes. Its open nature, hybrid approach and
inclusive design facilitates widespread participation support.

A strengthened IGF may need to develop and adopt new working methods
that can deliver genuinely improved coordination, insight and
information sharing while avoiding conflicts with existing processes or
creating new burdens to participating stakeholders and the UN system.

A strengthened Internet Governance Forum (IGF):

-   requires long term sustainability through increased financial,
    technical and human resources to be consolidated as a pivotal
    deliberative platform for coordinating participative debates on
    Internet and digital governance;
-   can provide cohesion and facilitate participation in the context of
    a distributed and growing digital governance ecosystem, ensuring
    more inclusive and diverse participation of under-represesented
    countries, communities and sectors, in particular from the Global
    South; and
-   requires improved procedures to guarantee inclusive deliberation, to
    generate both legitimacy and effective outcomes.

In its evolution, the potential of the IGF to deliver tangible outcomes
(such as evidence-based policy recommendations, best practice guidelines
and pilot projects to test proposed solutions) in order to build
capacity and inform policymakers should be optimized. This will require
the commitment and participation of all stakeholders.

The IGF Secretariat, the IGF Leadership Panel and the Multistakeholder
Advisory Group, in the performance of their respective functions, have a
key role to play in that regard. Mechanisms for collaboration and
information exchange with other international bodies and governance fora
should be enhanced, as well as IGF's intersessional work. The
strengthening of national and regional IGFs, as spaces for the
definition of common goals and challenges to inform the global IGF
agenda, contributes to tackle governance fragmentation.

The IGF is the process in the UN system that is best positioned to
address the gap between discussion and action by building closer ties
with other organizations that are central to the functioning of the
Internet, but also with multilateral institutions, through ongoing
innovation and experimentation within the IGF framework.

The IGF should be renewed as the foremost global platform for
broad-based public participation and dialogue in all Internet and
related digital governance matters. Through strengthening the IGF we
would allow for the UN system to leverage on the legacy and relevance of
the model while avoiding further fragmentation of the Internet
Governance discussions.

## 4.2. Global Digital Compact

In order to set the grounds for an \"open, free and secure digital
future for all\" as envisaged by the Global Digital Compact,
NETmundial+10 recognizes the essential role of the Internet and digital
technologies to build inclusive and participatory governance mechanisms,
reaffirming the importance of a multistakeholder approach to Internet
and digital governance and embedding it in its core. The recommendations
emerging from NETmundial+10 towards strengthening the multistakeholder
approach to the governance of digital technologies and development are a
basis to ensure that policies and frameworks are inclusive, democratic,
and reflect the diverse perspectives of all sections of society.

In the perspective of adding value and filling the gaps in the current
structures in Internet governance fora, the GDC should avoid creating
new structures or processes where existing ones could be strengthened
and improved to support in monitoring the implementation and reviewing
progress of the GDC. For many reasons the IGF is the appropriate venue
to follow up and monitor implementation of the GDC's commitments. The
topics set out in the GDC, and driving so much of the focus on digital
governance, are already on the IGF agenda and have been for many years.

The IGF with its structures and mechanisms should be used as a space to
facilitate implementation and monitoring of the Global Digital Compact,
working in collaboration with other UN agencies such as the ITU, UNDP,
UNCTAD and UNESCO, through the WSIS Action Lines, and with the UN CSTD
providing a platform for intergovernmental engagement in the monitoring
process.

Through its implementation oriented to integrate its outcomes with the
WSIS process and effective follow up mechanisms building on existing
fora, the GDC is an instrument to integrate digital into the
acceleration of implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.

The GDC is an opportunity to put digital technologies on track for
global efforts that pursue digital inclusion, cross-border cooperation
and collaboration among the different stakeholders, the consolidation
and effective application of existing human rights international
standards, underscoring the centrality of the international human rights
framework as both a foundation for and an enabling environment to
support all aspects of Internet governance.

## 4.3. WSIS+20 Review

The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) has served as a
pivotal platform for fostering cooperation among governments, civil
society, private sector, academia and technical communities to
collectively address the opportunities and challenges brought about by
the digital age for technical and public policy issues in digital
governance. As the WSIS+20 milestone approaches, a renewed commitment
and innovative strategies for achieving digital inclusion and protecting
human rights online is needed for leveraging the SDGs. The
multistakeholder model, which recognizes the intricate interplay of
various sectors and actors to shape digital policy, is fundamental in
ensuring that WSIS remains a dynamic process based on the development of
global standards and cooperation mechanisms around key digital issues,
agile and responsive to the expanding frontiers of new technologies. By
building on a strong commitment to multistakeholderism, fostering
cooperation and discussing the potential challenges, evolving
technologies and trends within the digital landscape, WSIS can prepare
for and look beyond the 20-year milestone.

## 4.4. Other Processes

NETmundial+10 highlights the value of coordinating the different
processes that deal with the governance of the digital world, including
regional and local initiatives, in order to achieve a holistic and
consistent view. It is key that those processes also follow inclusive
and transparent multistakeholder processes, with a prioritization of
efforts to bridge the digital divide and promote digital inclusion,
particularly in underserved communities and regions.

Relevant organizations and processes include, *inter alia*:

-   The broader UN community, including ITU, UNESCO, WIPO, OHCHR, OEWG
    and others, which should strive for strong interaction and
    collaboration between multistakeholder and multilateral processes;
-   The UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Agenda, emphasizing the
    role of digital inclusion and access to information technologies and
    advocating for global cooperation in leveraging digital innovation
    for sustainable development initiatives;
-   The I\* community, including ISOC, ICANN, RIRs, ccTLDs, IETF and
    W3C;
-   The OECD, in particular recommending strategies for inclusive growth
    through digital transformation, emphasizing skills development and
    access to digital tools;
-   The G20 Digital Economy Working Group, which should stress the
    importance of global data governance frameworks that respect
    privacy, promote data protection, and facilitate trust in digital
    transactions;
-   The Internet & Jurisdiction Policy Network, promoting a harmonized
    legal framework for digital interactions and cross-border
    cooperation to combat cybercrime.

Other processes to which the NETmundial+10 outcomes are of great
relevance include:

-   National and regional digital policy formulation processes, where
    multistakeholder participation in digital policy formulation can be
    encouraged, which will bring emphasis to the importance of
    transparency, accountability, and citizen participation in the
    implementation of digital policies;
-   International negotiation processes on Technology and Trade
    Agreements, where the message would be to ensure protection of
    intellectual property rights without compromising equitable access
    to technology and information as well as consideration of the
    social, economic, and environmental impacts of trade policies
    related to technology;
-   Technological standards development processes, encouraging the
    adoption of open and interoperable standards that promote
    accessibility, security, and innovation, as well as enhancing
    multistakeholder participation;
-   High Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence - HLAB/AI and
    other organizations and platforms dealing with this issue should
    strive for an ethical development that prioritizes transparency,
    accountability, and the mitigation of bias.
